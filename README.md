# ipavec

This is the home of my bachelor thesis, **IPA alignment using vector
representations**, which presents several different methods for obtaining
embeddings of IPA segments in vector space for the purposes of IPA sequence
alignment. The repo contains the code implementation, the training and
evaluation data, as well as the thesis paper.


## setup

```bash
# clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/pavelsof/ipavec
cd ipavec

# create a python3 virtual environment
python3 -m venv meta/venv
source meta/venv/bin/activate

# install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# check the unit tests
python -m unittest discover code
```


## usage

```bash
# activate the virtual env if it is not already
source meta/venv/bin/activate

# ensure reproducibility of the results
export PYTHONHASHSEED=42

# use train.py to produce embeddings for one of the trainable methods
python train.py --help

# use run.py to run a method on a dataset and output aligned pairs
python run.py --help

# use eval.py to evaluate the output if you have the gold-standard alignments
python eval.py --help
```

### phoible

```bash
python run.py data/bdpa/slavic.psa --vectors phoible --output output/slavic-phoible.psa
python eval.py data/bdpa/slavic.psa output/slavic-phoible.psa | less
```

### phon2vec

```bash
python train.py phon2vec data/northeuralex/ipa --output models/phon2vec
python run.py data/bdpa/slavic.psa --vectors phon2vec --output output/slavic-phon2vec.psa
python eval.py data/bdpa/slavic.psa output/slavic-phon2vec.psa | less
```

### nn+rnn

```bash
python train.py nn data/northeuralex/ipa --extra epochs=10,batch_size=128
python run.py data/bdpa/slavic.psa --vectors nn --output output/slavic-nn.psa
python eval.py data/bdpa/slavic.psa output/slavic-nn.psa | less

python train.py rnn data/northeuralex/word_pairs --extra batch_size=128,from_model=models/nn
python run.py data/bdpa/slavic.psa --vectors rnn --output output/slavic-rnn.psa
python eval.py data/bdpa/slavic.psa output/slavic-rnn.psa | less
```


## evaluation

The table summarises the accuracy achieved by the implemented methods on the
[BDPA datasets][bdpa]. The last column lists the results of [SCA][sca], the
state-of-the-art IPA alignment method at the time of writing.
